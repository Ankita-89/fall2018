## Maps

The Earth is a sphere.

(Fun question: to what degree is it a sphere?)

Have you ever wrapped a piece of paper around a ball?

---

## Projections

To map from one system to another, we must "project" from the original sphere
to the flat object we are observing.

What are some things we could preserve during such a projection?

---

## Projections: Common Preservations

Typically, one or more of these will be preserved, or at least, the distortion
will be minimized:

 * Area
 * Shape (Conformal)
 * Distance

There are other properties that can be preserved, as well.  Typically, maps
will be a "compromise" between preserving different properties.

What happens when we preserve one property over another?

---

Mercator is a "conformal" projection.  What is wrong with this?

---

## Projections: Distortions

We can characterize distortions in a projection by examining how a known shape
appears on them.  The Tissot Ellipse of Distortion is a method of showing this
by drawing circles of a fixed radius and examining their elliptical distortion.

## Discussion

What happens when we make a map that minimizes one region and maximizes
another?

---

## Maps: Coordinate Systems

Once we have our system of transformation, we need to have a method of
representing positions.

Three common baseline methods:

 * Spherical coordinates
 * Latitude and Longitude
 * Degrees, minutes, seconds

Take care with:

 * Zero points
 * North/South, East/West
 * Ranges

---

## Intro to cartopy

CartoPy is a toolkit that builds on matplotlib to create fast, easy map
representations.

We will be relying on three key concepts:

 * Axes projections (similar to our polar projections)
 * Coordinate representations
 * Shapes

Using these, we will be able to build out many visualizations.

---

## CartoPy: Projections

We start out by constructing an axes in CartoPy that uses a given projection:

```python
import cartopy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=cartopy.crs.Mollweide())
ax.coastlines()
```

What does this do?

---

## CartoPy: Coordinate Reference Systems

Transforming from a spherical reference system to a flat reference system is
the job of the projection; transforming from one discretization of a sphere to
another is the job of the coordinate system.

We can utilize Coordinate Reference Systems to describe the *input* coordinate
system and the *rasterization* system are described.

For example, there are several different ways to draw "straight" lines.  We can
do both `PlateCarree` and `Geodetic`.

```python
c_lat, c_lon = 40.1164, -88.2434
a_lat, a_lon = -18.8792, 47.5079
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection = cartopy.crs.PlateCarree())
ax.gridlines()
ax.coastlines()
ax.set_global()
ax.plot([c_lon, a_lon], [c_lat, a_lat], transform = cartopy.crs.PlateCarree())
ax.plot([c_lon, a_lon], [c_lat, a_lat], transform = cartopy.crs.Geodetic())
```

## CartoPy: Examples

Let's now set up CartoPy to plot some of the data we saw last week, in the
transportable array.

---

## Other Map Viz

 * Google Maps & Earth
 * WorldWide Telescope
 * CesiumJS

## Assignment

Your assignment is posted in the `nbgrader` instance.  You have a week and a
half, but it's easy.

## Idyll

Idyll is a reactive markup language for visualization and narrative documents.

[idyll-lang.org](idyll-lang.org)

We will create a name explorer.
