## Matthew Turk
## Fall 2018
## Lecture 13

## Warm-Up Activity

 1. What is the visualization trying to show?
 1. What are its methods?
 1. What are the strengths / weaknesses?
 1. Would you know how to make something like this?

## Today

 * Final Project Update
 * Review of Tools
 * Building Stuff
 * Data Scavenger Hunt

---

## Next Week

 * Next week, you will present.
 * Each group will have up to 10 minutes.
 * You should present your final product first, whatever form it takes.
 * Walk us back through to the beginning, and why you chose the dataset.

---

## Tools We've Used

We've learned a number of different tools in class.

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Bqplot
* IPython widgets
* Cartopy
* Vega
* Vega-lite
* R
* Idyll

Each of these has strengths and weaknesses.

## Questions To Ask

* Do I know anything about the data?
  * What form will it take?
  * What tale do I think it will tell?
* How should I present this data?
  * Can the data be reconstructed from my visualization?
  * What technical issues impede clarity?
  * Am I providing visual context?
* How will this visualization be received?
  * What implicit or explicit assumptions am I making about the observer?
  * What questions will they ask of it?
  * Do I have empathy for my viewer?

---

## Building Stuff

Let's return to that visualization.

Do you know how to build something like that?

What tools could you use?

Where would you put it?

---

## Publishing Pages

GitHub pages is a simple, straightforward way to publish websites.

 * Static-site generation using Jekyll
 * Manual HTML building
 * Integration with other systems (Idyll)

---

## Publishing Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks can be published online.  The simplest way:

 * Commit them to a github repository
 * View them using nbviewer.jupyter.org

Widget state can be saved in many cases.

## Your First Github Page

 * We will use Jekyll to build a github page
 * Create the repository `[username].github.io`
 * Clone this repository.
 * Let's talk about the branches `gh-pages` and `master`

---

## Data Scavenger Hunt

 * Count off into groups
 * We will work on one dataset at a time
   * Load the dataset into an editor or notebook
   * Prototype a visualization of that dataset by hand
   * Develop a visualization
   * Keep track of iterations on the visualization
 * Two datasets:
   * Names database
   * WDI
 * Thirty minutes for each dataset, ten minutes of presentation after
