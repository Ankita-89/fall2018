## Today's Topics

 * Elements of a Visualization
 * Distributions

## Data Types

When we are examining data, what can we look for?

 * Does this data describe a **geometric** object?
 * Are the data points **connected** to each other?
 * Can we describe data points with a fixed set of **categories**?
 * Is there a **quantity** associated with the data?
 * Are the datapoints **continuous** along one or more dimensions?

## Example: Geometric Object

| v1 | v2 | cat |
|:-|:-|-:-|
|8.5|-9| r |
|10|-8| r |
|11.5|-7| r |
|12.5|-5.5| r |
|13|-4| r |
| ... | ... | ... |
|-2.5|-6|b|
|-1.5|-7|b|
| ... | ... | ... | 
<!-- .element class="left" -->

## Examples: Quantity

We can encode the values associated with a data point by modifying how we
express it.  To do so, we need to be able to identify the different components
of representation, and how we can scale between them.

---

## Dimensions of Representation

Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different
components of its representation.

 * Position

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dimensions_1.svg" data-background-size="auto 50%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Dimensions of Representation

Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different
components of its representation.

 * Position
 * Color

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dimensions_2.svg" data-background-size="auto 50%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Dimensions of Representation

Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different
components of its representation.

 * Position
 * Color
 * Size

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dimensions_3.svg" data-background-size="auto 50%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Dimensions of Representation

Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different
components of its representation.

 * Position
 * Color
 * Size
 * Shape

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/dimensions_4.svg" data-background-size="auto 50%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

## Dimensions of Representation

Given a single datum on a visualization, we can control several different
components of its representation.

 * Position
 * Color
 * Size
 * Shape
 * Relationship

## Continuous Data

Data organized in a continuous fashion along one or more dimensions can enable
additional operations.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/cube.png" data-background-size="auto 50%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

## Continuous Data

Data organized in a continuous fashion along one or more dimensions can enable
additional operations.

## Distributions

Given a point or set of points, how do we make them into a "continuous"
distribution?

## Distributions

Given a point or set of points, how do we make them into a "continuous"
distribution?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/binning_2.svg" data-background-size="75% auto" -->

---

## Distributions

Given a point or set of points, how do we make them into a "continuous"
distribution?

Uniform-width bins allow us to compute:

```python
bin_id = floor( (value - left_edge ) / bin_width)
```

## Distributions

Given a point or set of points, how do we make them into a "continuous"
distribution?

Non-uniform bins require searching.

## Binning and Histograms

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../week03/images/circles_grid_filled.svg" data-background-size="auto 75%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

* $\Sigma 1$ (count)
* $\Sigma v_i$ (sum)
* $\frac{\Sigma v_i }{ \Sigma 1}$ (average)
* $\frac{\Sigma v_i w_i}{\Sigma w_i}$ (weighted average)

---

## Summation

Useful for describing total quantity measured.

* Inches of rain.
* Total time of recorded UFO sitings in the area.
* How many votes were cast?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../week03/images/circles_grid.svg" data-background-size="auto 75%" data-background-position="right 20% bottom 50%"-->

---

## Arithmetic Average

Useful for describing average or mean quantity.

* Average rainfall in the area.
* Average time of UFO sighting.
* Who was the average candidate?

---

## Weighted Average

Useful for describing mean, but not strict arithmetic mean.

* Average rainfall, weighted by how humid it was that day.
* What was the most commonly seen UFO type, as a function of the time it was
  seen?
* What's the mean age of a voter, as a function of the total years of
  experience in the election?
